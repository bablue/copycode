Iâ€™d like to inform you that the following steps have been successfully completed for setting up Resource Health Alerts and Service Health Alerts on the APIM:

The code implementation has been completed and pushed to the repository: [<repo-url>].
JET SPNs have been created.
The necessary changes to the pipeline-config.yml files have been made, and the files have been updated with the new Secret ID and certificate PFX, reflecting the changes in the Jules pipeline.
Code has been written to assign the Owner and Contributor roles to the newly created SPNs, and this is available at [<repo-url>].
Please let me know if you need further details or assistance.
